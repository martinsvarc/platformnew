# Multi-Team Feature - Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration
```bash
psql -d your_database_name -f enable_multi_team_accounts.sql
```

This removes the unique email constraint and allows one email to have multiple team accounts.

### Step 2: Create Your Second Team Account

As an admin, you have two options:

**Option A: Register as Admin in New Team**
1. Log out of your current account
2. Go to `/adminstart` or the registration page
3. Use the **same email** as your existing account
4. Enter a username (can be same or different)
5. Enter your password (the system will use your existing password automatically)
6. Complete registration

**Option B: Have Another Admin Create Your Account**
1. Ask an admin of the target team to create an account for you
2. Provide them your existing email
3. The system will automatically use your existing password and PIN

### Step 3: Log In with Multiple Teams

1. Go to login page and enter your credentials
2. You'll see a **Team Selection** screen
3. Choose which team you want to access
4. Enter your PIN code (same PIN for all teams)
5. You're in!

### Step 4: Switch Between Teams

1. Open the navigation menu
2. Look for **"PÅ™epnout tÃ½m"** (Switch Team) under the admin section
3. Click to expand and see all your teams
4. Click on any team to switch to it
5. Page will reload with the new team's data
