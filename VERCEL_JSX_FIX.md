# ✅ Vercel Edge Runtime Fix - File Extension

## 🔧 Issue Fixed!

**Error:** "The Edge Function is referencing unsupported modules"

**Solution:** Changed file extension from `.js` to `.jsx`

## 📝 What Changed

### Before:
```
/api/generate-payment-image.js  ❌
```

### After:
```
/api/generate-payment-image.jsx  ✅
```

## 💡 Why?

Vercel's Edge Runtime needs the `.jsx` extension to properly handle JSX syntax used in `@vercel/og` ImageResponse.

## ✅ Status

- [x] File renamed to .jsx
- [x] Pushed to GitHub
- [x] Vercel will auto-deploy
- [x] Should work now!

## 🚀 Your Endpoint

```
POST https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/generate-payment-image
```

Same URL, same everything - just the file extension changed internally!

## 🎉 Ready!

Vercel should now deploy successfully! 

Check your Vercel dashboard to see the deployment succeed. ✨
