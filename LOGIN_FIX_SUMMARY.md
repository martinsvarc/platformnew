# Login 404 Error Fix - Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing 404 errors during login because:
1. Frontend code was trying to import server-side database functions directly
2. These functions (`auth.js`, `settings.js`, `signup.js`) use Neon database queries
3. Database queries cannot run in the browser, causing 404 errors

## Solution
Created Netlify serverless functions to handle database operations and updated frontend to call these API endpoints.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Netlify Functions (Serverless API Endpoints)

#### `/netlify/functions/auth.js`
Handles authentication operations:
- `login` - User login with password verification
- `getCurrentUser` - Get current user data
- `updateUserAvatar` - Update user avatar
- `updateUserLanguage` - Update user language preference
- `setupPIN` - Set up PIN 2FA
- `setupBiometric` - Set up biometric 2FA
- `get2FASettings` - Get user's 2FA settings
- `verifyUserPIN` - Verify user's PIN

#### `/netlify/functions/settings.js`
Handles app settings:
- `getSetting` - Get a specific setting
- `getAllSettings` - Get all settings for a team
- `updateSetting` - Update or create a setting
- `deleteSetting` - Delete a setting
- `getBackgroundUrl` - Get background image URL
- `updateBackgroundUrl` - Update background image URL
- `removeBackgroundUrl` - Remove background image URL

#### `/netlify/functions/signup.js`
Handles user registration:
- `signup` - Register a new user
- `signupAdmin` - Register a new admin user

### 2. Created Frontend API Clients

#### `/src/api/authClient.js`
Frontend client that calls the auth serverless function

#### `/src/api/settingsClient.js`
Frontend client that calls the settings serverless function

#### `/src/api/signupClient.js`
Frontend client that calls the signup serverless function

### 3. Updated Frontend Imports

Updated all files to use the new client APIs instead of importing server-side functions:

**Updated files:**
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Now uses `authClient`
- `src/pages/Login.jsx` - Now uses `settingsClient`
- `src/pages/Register.jsx` - Now uses `signupClient` and `settingsClient`
- `src/pages/AdminStart.jsx` - Now uses `signupClient`
- `src/pages/PINVerification.jsx` - Now uses `authClient` and `settingsClient`
- `src/pages/BiometricVerification.jsx` - Now uses `settingsClient`
- `src/components/PINSetup.jsx` - Now uses `authClient`
- `src/components/TwoFASetupPrompt.jsx` - Now uses `authClient`
- `src/components/BackgroundUploadWidget.jsx` - Now uses `settingsClient`
- `src/App.jsx` - Now uses `settingsClient`

## How It Works

### Before (Broken)
```
Browser → imports auth.js directly → tries to run SQL queries → 404 ERROR
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Browser → calls authClient.js → POST to /.netlify/functions/auth → runs SQL queries on server → returns data
```

## Testing the Fix

### Local Development

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install Netlify CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

3. **Start the dev server with Netlify Functions**:
   ```bash
   netlify dev
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Start the Vite dev server
   - Start the Netlify Functions server
   - Proxy API requests to the functions

4. **Test the login**:
   - Open the app (should open automatically or go to `http://localhost:8888`)
   - Try to log in with your credentials
   - Check browser console for any errors

### Alternative: Using Vite Dev Server

If you prefer using Vite's dev server directly:

```bash
npm run dev
```

However, this won't run the Netlify Functions locally. For full functionality, use `netlify dev`.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required (already configured in `.env`):

- `VITE_DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string (for Netlify Functions)
- `DATABASE_URL` - Alternative database connection string
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For AI assistant features (optional for login)

## Next Steps (Optional - Not Required for Login)

The following API modules also use database queries and may need to be converted to serverless functions if you encounter 404 errors in other parts of the app:

1. `src/api/queries.js` - Used by many pages for data fetching
2. `src/api/bookmarks.js` - Used by bookmarks page
3. `src/api/payments.js` - Used by payment pages
4. `src/api/teams.js` - Team management
5. `src/api/banks.js` - Bank account management
6. `src/api/models.js` - Models management

These are not required for login to work, but will be needed for those specific features.

## Deployment

When deploying to Netlify:
1. Ensure all environment variables are set in Netlify dashboard
2. The functions will automatically be deployed to `/.netlify/functions/*`
3. No additional configuration needed (already configured in `netlify.toml`)

## Notes

- All Netlify Functions include CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Functions use the same database connection and encryption methods as before
- No changes to database schema or stored data
- Frontend API clients maintain the same interface as original functions
