# ✅ Vercel Canvas Fix - Using @vercel/og

## 🎉 Issue Resolved!

The `canvas` package requires native dependencies that aren't available in Vercel's serverless environment. 

**Solution:** Switched to **@vercel/og** - Vercel's official image generation library!

## 🚀 What Changed

### Before (canvas - ❌ Doesn't work on Vercel)
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "canvas": "^2.11.2"  // ❌ Requires native Cairo libraries
  }
}
```

### After (@vercel/og - ✅ Works perfectly!)
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@vercel/og": "^0.6.2"  // ✅ Native to Vercel Edge Runtime
  }
}
```

## 💡 Benefits of @vercel/og

✅ **No Native Dependencies** - Pure JavaScript, no Cairo/Pango needed
✅ **Edge Runtime** - Runs on Vercel's fast Edge network
✅ **React-Based** - Use JSX to design images (cleaner code!)
✅ **Officially Supported** - Made by Vercel for Vercel
✅ **Faster** - Optimized for serverless environments
✅ **No Build Issues** - Deploys instantly

## 📝 Same API, Better Performance!

Your API endpoint remains exactly the same:

```
POST https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/generate-payment-image
```

Same request body:
```json
{
  "chatterName": "Anna K.",
  "paymentAmount": 5000,
  "clientName": "Client#123"
}
```

Same beautiful images! 🎨

## 🚀 Deploy Now

```bash
# 1. Install new dependency
npm install

# 2. Push to GitHub (if not done yet)
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix: Switch from canvas to @vercel/og for Vercel compatibility"
git push origin main

# 3. Vercel will auto-deploy!
```

Your images will now generate successfully on Vercel! ✨

## 🎨 Design Unchanged

The images still feature:
- ✅ Platform colors (Neon Orchid purple & Sunset Gold)
- ✅ Profile pictures
- ✅ All payment information
- ✅ Beautiful gradient text
- ✅ 1200x1400px (perfect for Telegram)
- ✅ Professional layout

## 📱 n8n Integration - No Changes!

Your n8n workflow remains exactly the same:

**HTTP Request Node:**
- URL: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/generate-payment-image`
- Method: POST
- Response Format: File
- Binary Property: data

Everything works as before! 🎉
