# Security Notes - 2FA System

## 🔐 Security Model

### REMOVED: /clear-storage Page
**This feature was removed due to security vulnerability.**

**The Problem:**
- If attacker has your password, they could use /clear-storage to reset 2FA
- Then set up THEIR OWN Touch ID/PIN
- This defeats the entire purpose of 2FA!

**Correct Approach:**
- Only admins can reset user 2FA (via Team Members dashboard)
- Users who are locked out must contact admin
- This maintains 2FA security even if password is compromised

## 🚨 Attack Scenarios & Mitigations

### Scenario 1: Stolen Password (Without 2FA)
**Attack:** Attacker knows your password
**Mitigation:** 
- ✅ 2FA blocks login! Attacker can't access account
- ✅ They don't have your Touch ID or PIN code
- 🔒 **This is why 2FA exists!**

### Scenario 2: Lost Access to 2FA
**Legitimate Issue:** You're locked out (domain mismatch, lost PIN, etc.)
**Solution:**
- 🔒 Contact admin to reset your 2FA
- 🔒 Admin uses "Reset 2FA" button in Team Members dashboard
- 🔒 You login with password and set up 2FA fresh
- ✅ This maintains security even if password is known

### Scenario 3: Domain Mismatch
**Use Case:** Set up 2FA on localhost, now stuck on production
**Solution:**
- 🔒 Clear browser data manually (F12 → Application → Clear Storage)
- 🔒 OR contact admin to reset your 2FA
- ✅ Then login and set up fresh 2FA on correct domain

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Lock Your Computer:** Always lock screen when away
2. **Strong Passwords:** Use unique, complex passwords
3. **One Device:** Don't share devices or login credentials
4. **Report Suspicious Activity:** If logged out unexpectedly, contact admin
5. **Password Security:** If compromised, change password immediately

### For Admins
1. **Monitor 2FA Changes:** Check when users reset 2FA
2. **Reset 2FA Button:** Use "Reset 2FA" button in Team Members dashboard
3. **Investigate Anomalies:** Unexpected 2FA resets should be investigated
4. **User Education:** Inform users about security best practices

## 🔑 What Actually Protects Your Account

1. **Password** (Primary security)
   - Without password, attacker cannot login
   - 2FA is secondary authentication

2. **Physical Device Security**
   - Lock screen when away
   - Don't leave computer unattended while logged in
   - Use full-disk encryption

3. **2FA as Additional Layer**
   - Protects against remote password theft
   - Requires physical device (Touch ID) or knowledge (PIN)
   - But if both password AND physical access, account is at risk

## 📋 If You Suspect Compromise

### Immediate Actions
1. **Change Password** immediately
2. **Contact Admin** to reset 2FA
3. **Check Account Activity** for unauthorized changes
4. **Review Recent Logins** (if logging is enabled)

### Admin Actions
1. Navigate to Admin → Team Members
2. Click "Reset 2FA" for the affected user
3. Force user to set up 2FA again on next login
4. Investigate any suspicious activity

## 💡 Why Admin-Only Reset?

**Security > Convenience:**
- 2FA protects against stolen passwords
- Self-service reset would defeat this protection
- Admin reset adds human verification layer

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
1. ❌ Self-service /clear-storage → Allows attackers with password to bypass 2FA
2. ❌ Email-based recovery → Could work but adds complexity
3. ✅ **Current:** Admin-only reset → Secure and simple

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Your account security depends on:**
1. **Password strength** (prevents initial access)
2. **2FA** (protects even if password is stolen)
3. **Admin-controlled reset** (prevents attacker from bypassing 2FA)

**Protection model:**
- ❌ Just password → Can't login (needs 2FA)
- ❌ Just 2FA → Can't login (needs password)
- ✅ Password + 2FA → Can login
- ❌ Password + reset attempt → Blocked (only admin can reset)

**If locked out:**
1. Contact admin
2. Admin resets 2FA via dashboard
3. Login with password
4. Set up fresh 2FA

**If compromised:**
1. Change password immediately
2. Contact admin to reset 2FA
3. Check for unauthorized access
