- **Klientiaplatby Page**: 50% translated (large file - 1,062 lines)
- **Estimated Total**: ~75% of all user-visible text

## 🎯 What's Left

The Klientiaplatby page is very large and still needs:
- Payments tab filters and table
- Modal dialogs (email, phone, notes editors)
- Some button labels
- Transaction details view
- Currency formatting in all amounts

## ⚡ Quick Test

1. Make sure you ran the database migration:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS language VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'cs';
   ```

2. Start app: `npm run dev`
3. Login
4. Click language switcher → Switch to English
5. Navigate through pages - most should be in English now!

## 📝 Note

The app is **highly usable in English** now. The remaining translations are mostly in the Clients & Payments page which is a large admin/data-entry page. All the main user-facing pages (Login, Performance, Score) are 100% translated with proper currency support!
